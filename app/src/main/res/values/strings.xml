  <string name="aboutText" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">
     FP sDraw - 🗒️ is your sheet that is always at hand. A convenient tool that helps in everyday life.
     \n
     \n✨ Nothing extra - You open it and draw immediately. No ads or intrusive notifications. It has a pleasant and thoughtful design. You can quickly create a sketch, finish a photo, or create a meme.
     \n🖋️ The program supports digital pen capabilities: sPen, Smart Pen, Active Pen, etc.
     \n⛑️ While you draw, the program periodically creates backup copies to keep your drawing safe.
     \n
     \n👀 And now more details...
     \nAfter opening the program, you don\'t need to spend time creating a project - the sheet is already ready for drawing.
     \nThe program is less than a megabyte in size, works stably and quickly on most devices, and does not drain the phone with background activity. Compatible with both current Android versions and Android 2.3 😳
     \n
     \nWhen drawing, the following options are available:
     \n- ↕️ Convenient access to functions using the volume keys;
     \n- ⏳ Canceling and repeating actions, for many steps;
     \n- 💾 Saving a drawing, several options to choose from;
     \n- 📋 Inserting pictures from the gallery or from the clipboard. You can insert after removing the background;
     \n- ⚙️ Flexible settings, you can even choose the shape of the buttons 🤩
     \n- ❓ There are hints that do not distract, but will help you understand easily.
     \n- 🎁 And much more 😉
     \n
     \nIn addition to simple drawing, there are other tools:
     \n- ⬜ Eraser, for erasing what is drawn;
     \n- 🏺 Painting to fill the drawn figure;
     \n- 🧩 Mosaic to hide something in the photo;
     \n- 🅰️ Adding text, with font selection;
     \n- ✂️ Selecting and moving a fragment of a picture;
     \n- 🔳 Drawing shapes (rectangle, triangle, etc.);
     \n- 📏 Ruler, for drawing straight lines;
     \n- 🎨 Eyedropper to choose a color from the canvas;
     \n- 🖱️ Precision brush, a unique tool that allows you to easily make small changes to your drawing.
     \n
     \n
     \n☕ That\'s almost all...
     \nIn this description, it is impossible to describe the many features of the program, so it is easier to try it once than to read it 100 times 😉.
     \nJust a reminder, the program "weighs" less than a megabyte 😊
